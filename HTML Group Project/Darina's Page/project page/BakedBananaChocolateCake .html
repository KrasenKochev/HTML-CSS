  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#banana-benefits">400g bananas (about 2 bananas)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#egg-benefits">3 eggs</a></li>
    <li><a href="#coconut-flour-benefits">40g coconut flour (about 3 heaped tablespoons)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#chocolate-benefits">80g chocolate (85% cocoa)</a></li>
    <li>1 packet of baking powder</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Take the two bananas and bake them in the oven at 250°C for 15 minutes. This duration is enough for the bananas to turn black while the insides cook, maximizing the banana aroma.</li>
    <li>Once baked, remove the bananas from the oven, peel them, and place the soft flesh into a bowl. Mash them using a fork or a potato masher. Let it cool for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>After cooling, break the eggs into the banana mixture and mix thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Add the coconut flour and baking powder to the banana-egg mixture and stir again.</li>
    <li>Break the chocolate into small pieces and mix it into the batter.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture into a baking tin and bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 30-35 minutes.</li>
