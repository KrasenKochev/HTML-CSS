    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil cooking spray over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until
            translucent.
        </li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and lean ground turkey to the skillet. Cook until the turkey is browned and cooked
            through. Season with dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the marinara sauce and fresh spinach leaves. Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes until
            the spinach is wilted.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the low-fat cottage cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, start assembling the lasagna. Begin with a thin layer of the turkey and spinach
            mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Place three cooked lasagna noodles over the mixture.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the cottage cheese and mozzarella mixture.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, alternating between the turkey mixture, noodles, and cheese mixture, until all
            ingredients are used. Ensure the top layer is the cheese mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
