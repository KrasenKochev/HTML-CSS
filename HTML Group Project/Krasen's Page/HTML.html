                <p >Our original recipe for sweet potato brownies was so popular that we've tried to make them even better for you.
                <p>We wanted something gooier,
                    richer, more chocolaty and all round more indulgent and these are the result of that.</p>
                I promise you’d never know there was any veg in here at all!</p>

                <ul >
                    <li >Preheat the oven to 180c, fan setting.</li>
                    <li >Place the sweet potato into a steamer or in a saucepan with boiling water for 15-30 minutes,
                        until they become really soft (the length of time will depend on the size of the chunks).</li>
                    <li >While the sweet potatoes cook, grind the oats in a food processor until they form a flour (if not already), place to one side.</li>
                    <li >Once the sweet potatoes are soft and beginning to fall apart, drain them and add them to a food processor with the pitted dates.
                        Blend until smooth. Now add the remaining ingredients (except the chocolate) and blend until smooth. Once blended, stir through the chocolate chips (if using).</li>
                    <li >Spoon the mixture into a lined baking dish and cook for 45-50 minutes until you can pierce the brownie with a fork and bring it out clean.</li>
                    <li >Remove the tray and allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes – this is really important as it needs this time to stick together.</li>
                    <li >For the chocolate sauce, simply place all the ingredients into a pan over a medium heat.
                        Stir continuously until everything is melted and has come together to form a smooth sauce, about 5 minutes. Pour on top of the brownies when ready to serve.</li>
                </ul>
