Healthy Recipes Project

The Healthy Recipes is a collaborative project made by The Quality Squad buddy group.
This project focuses on creating an interactive website featuring a collection of nutritious and delicious recipes.
With the aim of promoting healthy eating habits, we have designed a main page that serves as a gateway to six individual recipe pages.
Each recipe page is dedicated to a specific dish, providing detailed ingredients, step-by-step cooking instructions, and nutritional information.
This project showcases our combined efforts to inspire others to adopt a balanced and health-conscious approach to their culinary journey.
